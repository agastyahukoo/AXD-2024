PROJECT_NAME = "OpenCV-Drone"
VERSION = "v0.1"
DESCRIPTION = (
    "This project is developed by the AeroXperts team at MPSTME for the AeroTHON 2024.\n\n"
    "This project utilizes OpenCV for real-time computer vision processing to enhance the droneâ€™s performance in AeroTHON 2024. "
    "The system is designed for Unmanned Aerial Competition (UAC) tasks such as object detection, tracking, and autonomous navigation.\n\n"
    "Key features include:\n"
    "- Real-time Object Detection: Implementing state-of-the-art algorithms for detecting and classifying objects using OpenCV libraries.\n"
    "- Motion Tracking: Incorporating motion tracking algorithms to follow moving objects and ensure precise aerial positioning.\n"
    "- Autonomous Navigation: Enabling the drone to navigate autonomously by interpreting camera feed and performing obstacle avoidance.\n"
    "- Hardware Integration: Seamless integration with onboard systems to process data efficiently during flight.\n"
    "- Performance Optimization: Ensuring minimal latency for real-time decision making with optimized processing techniques."
